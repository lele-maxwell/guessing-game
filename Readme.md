## 📜 About the Project

**Guessing Game** is my **first Java project!** 🚀  
It's a fun command-line game where the computer picks a secret number, and you try to guess it before you run out of lives.

Along the way, I learned:
- 🌟 Basic Java syntax
- 🌟 How to use `Scanner` for user input
- 🌟 How to work with `Random` numbers
- 🌟 Using `if-else`, `while` loops, and `switch` cases
- 🌟 Building a complete interactive program

This project helped me start my Java journey and gave me a solid foundation for bigger projects! 🧱💻

   - 🔫 **Normal** → Guess a number between 1 and 100
   - 🔫 **Hard** → Guess a number between 1 and 200
3. You have **5 lives** ❤️ to guess the correct number.
4. After each wrong guess:
   - You'll get a hint if your guess was **too low** or **too high**.
